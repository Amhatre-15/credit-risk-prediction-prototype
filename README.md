# 📌 Project Overview

This project builds a **Credit Risk Prediction System** using Machine Learning to determine whether a loan applicant is likely to be **safe or risky** for lending.

Financial institutions need to evaluate loan applications carefully to minimize the risk of default. This project demonstrates how **data science and machine learning models can help automate credit risk assessment**.

The project includes:

• Data analysis using **Python and Jupyter Notebook**
• Training a **machine learning classification model**
• Saving the trained model using **Pickle**
• Creating a **Streamlit web application** for user interaction

# ⚙️ Technologies Used

**Programming Language**

• Python

**Libraries & Tools**

• Pandas
• NumPy
• Scikit-learn
• Streamlit
• Pickle

---

# 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

The project follows a typical **machine learning pipeline**:

### 1️⃣ Data Collection

A loan dataset containing borrower details such as:

* Age
* Income
* Loan amount
* Credit history
* Other financial indicators

---

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

The dataset is cleaned and prepared by:

• Handling missing values
• Converting categorical variables
• Feature selection

---

### 3️⃣ Model Training

A machine learning classification model is trained to predict whether a loan is:

* **Safe**
* **Moderate Risk**
* **High Risk**

---

### 4️⃣ Model Saving

The trained model is saved using **Pickle** as:

```
credit_risk_model.pkl
```

This allows the model to be reused in the application without retraining.

---

### 5️⃣ Web Application

A **Streamlit app** (`app.py`) is built to allow users to input borrower details and receive a **risk prediction instantly**.

The app provides an interactive interface where users can enter:

• Age
• Income
• Loan information

The system then predicts the **credit risk category**.
